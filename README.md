# 2D JavaScript Game

## Introduction

Welcome to our 2D game, a classic arcade-style game developed purely in JavaScript without the need for any external libraries. This game is a testament to the capabilities of vanilla JavaScript in creating engaging and interactive web-based games.

## Testing and Bug Reporting Exercise

This game serves a dual purpose:

a) Testing the game thoroughly using various automated testing methods (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, etc.).
b) Identifying and reporting any bugs found in the game.

## Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation for participating in the development and testing of this game will be as follows:

- Creating a Manual Test Plan: 1 point.
- Automated Testing for Specific Features: Testing features such as movement, scoring, collision, and - game end automatically will earn 1 point for each feature successfully automated.
- Different Types of Automated Tests: 1 point for each type of automated test (unit, integration, end-to-end, etc.) that is functional.
- Best Coverage for Each Feature: 1 point for achieving the best test coverage for each feature (Scoring, Movement, End Game, Collision System).
- First to Correctly Report a Bug: 1 point for being the first to correctly report a bug.
- Code Refactoring for Readability and Testability: 1 point for refactoring the code to enhance readability and testability.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): 1 point for successfully implementing CI/CD in the project.
- Adding an Improvement/New Feature: 1 point for each improvement or new feature added to the game.

At the end of the allocated time, all projects will be reviewed, points will be summed up, and a winner will be announced.
